# learn-algorithm-design-by-building-a-shortest-path-algorithm
This repository explores algorithm design principles through the implementation of a shortest path algorithm. The algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, considering weighted edges.

Overview
The shortest path algorithm is a fundamental concept in graph theory and computer science. It plays a crucial role in various applications, including network routing, GPS navigation, and transportation planning. This repository provides an implementation of the shortest path algorithm in Python, allowing users to find the shortest route between nodes in a graph with weighted edges.

Usage
The main functionality of the algorithm is encapsulated in the shortest_path function. This function takes three arguments:

graph: A dictionary representing the graph with weighted edges.
start: The starting node for the shortest path search.
target (optional): The target node to find the shortest path to (if omitted, the function computes shortest paths to all nodes in the graph).
The function returns two dictionaries:

distances: A dictionary containing the shortest distance from the start node to each node in the graph.
paths: A dictionary containing the shortest path from the start node to each node in the graph.
